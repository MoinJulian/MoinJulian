## About me

Hi I'm Julian!

I'm 16 years old and love to build websites with Svelte and SvelteKit. I'm currently diving into Back End development with MongoDB and SvelteKit.

## Projects

My finished projects can be found on my [website](https://moinjulian.com).

### My favourite Project

My favorite project is my golf game SvelteKit applications, a website with three
different golf games and a user authentication with SvelteKit and MongoDB. The user can
save the games in the database and copy the data from the games tab and paste it on
the right game, also the games are always saved in the local storage, so the user can
continue playing from their old save game no matter if he has reloaded the site or
accidentally closed it, to start a new game the user has to click on the Restart Game
button or a team must have won, only then the data will be deleted from localStorage.

Here you can play the games: [Golf Games](https://golf.moinjulian.com)
