## About Me

I'm Julian, 18 years old and a driven Senior Software Engineer with a knack for building elegant, scalable web applications. As CEO of [RealGolf.Games](https://realgolf.games), I combine my love for golf and technology to create engaging, innovative gaming experiences.

When I'm not coding or managing projects, I enjoy exploring new frameworks, automating repetitive tasks (maybe a bit too much ðŸ˜‰), and of course playing golf.
