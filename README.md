## Projects

### My favourite Project

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=MoinJulian&repo=Golf&theme=dark&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/moinjulian/golf)

My favorite project is my **Real Golf** SvelteKit applications. 
A website with three different golf games and a user authentication with SvelteKit 
and MongoDB. The user can save the games in the database and copy the data from the 
games tab and paste it into the right game, also the games are always saved in the local 
storage, so the user can continue playing from their old saved game no matter if he has
reloaded the site or accidentally closed it, to start a new game the user has to click 
on the Restart Game button or a team must have won, only then the data will be deleted 
from localStorage.

Here you can play the games: [Real Golf](https://realgolf.games)
